# threading-example

This is a multi-threaded program that checks a list of numbers for primality. The first version of this program is *not* thread-safe. Compliling and running it will reveal problems: numbers checked more than once, -1 (a signalling value) checked for primality, 0 (another signalling value), or the program may fail to exit.

The 2nd version uses a Posix thread library mutex and condition variable to induce proper thread behavior.

A candidate who is versed in writing thread safe code should be able to understand the code and insert the necessary lines to make the program thread safe given 30 minutes time.

The thread unsafe code may appear to work if there is only one or two cores. With 4 cores available, problems will certainly manifest.

## Possible solutions
A clever candidate might point out that changing the number of threads to 1 would make the program nominally thread safe. (See line 108) That would not be the point.
